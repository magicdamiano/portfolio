Featured Projects
Handwritten Digit Classifier

Description: A machine learning model that classifies handwritten digits (0-9) using a custom PyTorch neural network trained on the MNIST dataset. Includes a Streamlit web app for real-time predictions.
Technologies: Python, PyTorch, Streamlit, scikit-learn, MNIST
Highlights: Achieves high accuracy, visualizes results with a confusion matrix, and offers an interactive UI for uploading digit images.
Demo: Upload a 28x28 grayscale digit image to see predictions in action.

[Project Name Placeholder] (Link TBD)

Description: (Add a new project, e.g., a robotics simulation using ROS or a blockchain smart contract in Solidity.)
Technologies: (e.g., ROS, Python, Solidity, Ethereum)
Highlights: (e.g., Real-time robot navigation, secure transaction processing)

More projects coming soon as I explore new challenges in AI, robotics, and blockchain!
